# Hello!
I am Thihan Moe Kyaw. I am currently a student studying Master of Science in Industrial Engineering at UIUC. I focus more on the pratical implementation of AI systems and a huge supporter for democratization of machine learning.

## Education
I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from University of Illinois at Chicago ([UIC](https://www.uic.edu/)). I further continued my academic journey at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://illinois.edu)) for my Master of Science in Industrial Engineering. For various reasons, I now focus on AI, specifically in natural language processing. My formal concentration is in advanced analytics and operations research for my master program.

## Work Experience
Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. I am responsible for automating machine learning models using Python for genomics study. Additionally, I am serving as the Lead Graduate Teaching Assistant (BDI 513: Data Storytelling) at Gies College of Business.

In the past, I've also served as a graudate Teaching Assistant for [CS 547: Deep Learning](https://publish.illinois.edu/r-sowers/ie534-cs-547-fall-2022/) and [IE 532: Integer Programming](https://ise.illinois.edu/undergraduate/courses/ie511) courses at Grainger College of Engineering. In my undergrad as well, I was a TA for the CS and the math department. Also, I was an undergrad research assistant at the [HiMER Lab](https://himer.lab.asu.edu/).

## Projects & Research Experiences 

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I worked on a project for Terrorist Network Detection. I collaborated with Industrial Engineering students to create a machine learning model to classify and analyze potential networks between terrorist organizations using over 18,000 terrorist events. In UIC, I worked with fermilab (along with ME and IE students) to build a proof-of-concept robot for the maintainance of the [NuMI system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuMI) using deep lerning for machine vision.
