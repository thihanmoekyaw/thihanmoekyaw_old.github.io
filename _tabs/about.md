# Hello!
 My name is Thihan Moe Kyaw. I am currently a student studying Master of Science in Industrial Engineering, with a focus on Advanced Analytics and Operations Research.

## Education
I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from University of Illinois at Chicago ([UIC](https://www.uic.edu/)). I further continued my academic journey at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://illinois.edu/)), where I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Industrial Engineering (Advanced Analytics & Operations Research), which is expected to be completed in May 2023.

## Work Experience
Currently, I am working a Graduate Research Assistant at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. I am responsible for creating automated machine learning dashboards using Python and for genomics study.

Additionally, I am serving as a Lead Graduate Teaching Assistant (BDI 513: Data Storytelling) at Gies College of Business, where I am leading and teaching over 90 MBA students on Tableau and data cleaning basics. I am also working collaboratively with the instructors to create data analytics assignments and modules for the course.

In the past, I have also served as a Data Science Teaching Assistant (CS 547: Deep Learning, IE 532: Integer Programming) at Grainger College of Engineering, where I answered and graded over 120 students on machine learning topics and graded homework and exams for a doctorate-level operations research/data analytics class with over 20 students.

## Projects & Research Experiences
At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I worked on a project for Terrorist Network Detection. I collaborated with other team members to create a machine learning model using Python to classify and analyze potential networks between terrorist organizations using over 18,000 terrorist events. I predicted the top 10 most influential terrorist organizations using Gurobi solver and showed which terrorist organizations were influenced by user-specified terrorist organizations.

I also worked on a Machine Vision & Robotics Project at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Fermilab. As part of a cross-disciplinary team, I collaborated on prototyping a robot to automate maintenance in highly radioactive environments. I integrated and trained a computer vision model using TensorFlow to detect nuts and bolts on the prototype robot.

## Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I am excited about the possibilities that data-driven solutions can bring to industries and communities. If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out to me at tkyaw2@illinois.edu or visit my Github page at github.com/thihanmoekyaw.
