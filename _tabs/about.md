# About me
 My name is Thihan Moe Kyaw. I am currently a student studying Master of Science in Industrial Engineering, with a focus on Advanced Analytics and Operations Research.

## Education
I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from University of Illinois at Chicago ([UIC](https://www.uic.edu/)). I further continued my academic journey at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://illinois.edu/)). I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Industrial Engineering (Advanced Analytics & Operations Research).

## Work Experience
Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. I am responsible for automating machine learning modle using Python and for genomics study. Additionally, I am serving as the Lead Graduate Teaching Assistant (BDI 513: Data Storytelling) at Gies College of Business.

In the past, I also served as a graudate Teaching Assistant for CS 547: Deep Learning and IE 532: Integer Programming courses at Grainger College of Engineering. In my undergrad, I was a TA for the CS and the math department as well. I was also a research assistant at the [HiMER Lab](https://himer.lab.asu.edu/).

## Projects & Research Experiences 

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I worked on a project for Terrorist Network Detection. I collaborated with other team members to create a machine learning model using Python to classify and analyze potential networks between terrorist organizations using over 18,000 terrorist events. Back in UIC, I worked with Fermilab to build a prototype robot for the maintainance of the [NuMI system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuMI) combining with machine learning to detect bolts.
